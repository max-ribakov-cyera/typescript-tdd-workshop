# Test-Driven Development Workshop: Building a User Service

Welcome to our TDD workshop! Today, we'll build a User Service from the ground up using Test-Driven Development.
We'll experience firsthand how TDD helps us evolve our design naturally and maintain high code quality. Let's dive in!

## Workshop Structure

### Each iteration follows this pattern:

- Story discussion
- Writing test together
- Implementation time
- Code review and refactoring

**The Solution for each iteration is available in the following iteration.**
Every iteration besides the first will have a **"Lessons Learned Section"** that will summarize the key takeaways from the previous iteration.
