# TypeScript TDD Workshop

A comprehensive workshop on Test-Driven Development with TypeScript, covering best practices, patterns, and real-world examples.

We'll build a User Service from the ground up using Test-Driven Development.
We'll experience firsthand how TDD helps us evolve our design naturally and maintain high code quality. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- TypeScript knowledge
- Basic testing experience

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/typescript-tdd-workshop.git
cd typescript-tdd-workshop
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## Workshop Structure

### Each iteration follows this pattern:

- Story discussion
- Writing test together
- Implementation time
- Code review and refactoring

**The Solution for each iteration is available in the following iteration.**
Every iteration besides the first will have a **"Lessons Learned Section"** that will summarize the key takeaways from the previous iteration.
